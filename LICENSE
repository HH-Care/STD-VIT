Project: STD Image Classifier using Vision Transformer (ViT-B16)
Description:
This project uses a Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) model to classify penile-related STD images into six categories: Genital_warts, HSV, Normal, Penile_cancer, Penile_candidiasis, and Syphillis. The model is built using TensorFlow and vit-keras, with a fine-tuned classification head.
